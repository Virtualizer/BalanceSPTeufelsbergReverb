Aidio
-----

### Aid + audio = Aidio.

MIT licensed DSP helper routines for sound applications.

Early version of audio DSP helper library covering high level routines not found in other libraries.

This is also a way of separating any JUCE work (GPL licensed) so that these routines may be used permissively in commercial projects etc.
