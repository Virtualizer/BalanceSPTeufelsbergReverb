### Aid + audio = Aidio.

Permissively licensed DSP helper routines for sound applications.

Early version of audio DSP helper library covering high level routines not found in other libraries.

This is also a way of excluding any GPL/copyleft licensed code (e.g. JUCE) so that these routines may be used permissively in commercial projects.
